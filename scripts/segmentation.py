    Apeture size (range[3,7]) is chosen to be the smallest possible. 
    Increasing apeture size will **increase** the number of edges found. 

    It is recommended to change the smoothing algorithm _before_ adjusting these parameters.

    Image dilation is used to increase the size of the existing lines. The kernel selected will dilate _white_ pixels. 

    Increasing iterations will further dilate the edge image. 
    '''
    dilation = cv2.dilate(edges,kernel_dilation,iterations = 1)
    # cv2.imshow("tmpImg", dilation) 
    cv2.imwrite("tmpImgB.png", dilation)

    TODO(Chris): Further morphological transformations, specifically Closing and Opening (see link above), will further increase the clarity of the edge image. It may be possible to reduce the intensity of the dilation algorithm after Closing andn Opening are added.

    Threshold, minLineLength, and maxLineGap are tuned to detect lines in the edge image.
